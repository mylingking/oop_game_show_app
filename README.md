# oop_game_show_app

This is a phrase-guessing game, built with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
I used Object-Oriented method to build its JavaScript.

## How to play

Open `index.html`, press the start game button and choose a letter, you only have 5 live hearts, each time a non-existing letter is chosen, you lose a heart. You will win by successfully choosing all the letters in the phrase.
